  -Adding "TEXTOUTXY" Command
   With this additional function you can send text to the Display without using the tty2oled scripts.
   ! The Serial Interface needs to be correctly configured !
   The Command-Parameter Format is "xxx,yy,f,[Text]" (! Changed see 2021-06-18)
   xxx = 3 Digits X-Position 000..255
   yy  = 2 Digits Y-Position 00..63 
   f   = Font Type
   Tip: Use the command "cls" to clear the screen => echo "cls" > /dev/ttyUSB01
   Example/Command Order: 
   1: echo "att" > /dev/ttyUSB0
   2: echo "TEXTOUTXY" > /dev/ttyUSB0
   3: echo "010,10,1,Text Out" > /dev/ttyUSB0

  -Trying to detect the Board chosen in the Arduino IDE (ESP32 Dev Module, WEMOS LOLIN32 or NODEMCU 8266) and set the Display config.
   No need to set the Board manually in the Sketch.
   But without the correct Board you get Compiler Errors.

  2021-05-22
  -Device CleanUp 

  2021-05-05
  -Add an Option to receive the Contrast Level from the MiSTer
   At First MiSTer needs to send "att"
   As Second MiSTer needs to send "CONTRAST"
   As Third MiSTer needs to send "[Contrast Value 0..255]"

  2021-04-??
  -Add "Set Contrast" to the Code by "ojaksch"

  2021-03-29
  -USB Version Based on SD Version
   Adding USB functionality from "ojaksch" (Many Thanks) and removed SD Stuff.
   Receive Picture-Data via Serial connection instead of the Corename from the MiSTer.
   Speed up Serial Interface to 115200
   Show a small "USB-Icon" on Startup Screen

  -Using #ifdef...#endif for my different HW-Configs (LOLIN32/TTGOT8)
   Choose ONLY one USE_xxxx Board definition at the beggining of the Sketch
  -Adding more Debug Infos

  2021-03-14
  -Using/Testing SD_MMC Mode (Should not matter in case of SD Access speed because of too small files. 
   Board 1: Lolin32 Board with Adafruit Micro SD SPI/SDIO Adapter. SD Access possible using SPI or 1/4.Bit SD Bus Mode.
   Board 2: TTGO_T8 v1.7.1 with integrated SD Slot. SD Access possible using SPI or 1.Bit SD Bus Mode.
   
   SD Adapter Excample Connections:
   SD Card | ESP32 4-Bit | ESP32 1-Bit (TTGO-T8)

  -Adding some Menu Effects
  -Code cleanup

  2021-02-16 (not released)
  -Make it more Universal 
   Add DispLineBytes , using more DispHeight & DispWidth instead of fixed Values

  2021-02-20/21
  -Using the Effects for all Picture/Logo Transistions (not only for the Menu)
  -"MENU" Picture moved from Code to the SD, makes it easier to change (if you like).
  -Modified Text Position calculation (see U8G2 Documentation for Details). 
   Change text reference position from TOP to BASELINE.
   Using now "getAscent" instead of "getMaxCharHeight" for Text Y-Position calculation.
  -Show a small "SD-Icon" on Startup Screen instead of the "dot" if SD Card was detected.

  2021-02-12
  -Adding some Menu Effects

  2021-02-11
  -Trying to make it more universal in case of used display sizes. Using more "DispHeight" and "DispWidth" instead of fixed values.
  2021-02
  -Change serial Speed to 57600
  -Adding SD Support for ESP32 using an dedicated SPI Interface
   Use now an TTGO-T8  ESP32 with integrated SD Micro Slot https://github.com/LilyGO/TTGO-T8-ESP32 .output
   All Logos or Picture have to be 256x64 Pixel (Display Size) in XBM Format.
   Place the Pictures to the root of the FAT or FAT32 formatted SD Card an give them the name like the core is named with extension (Lunar Lander = llander.xbm).
   Use Code from "XBM Read from FS" from https://github.com/lbernstone/eyes
  -Add "#define XDEBUG" for Debugging, can be Uncommented for more Infos over Serial
